# Programming Assignment

This is an initial assignment I was given while applying for a job. I'm going to keep it here as some example code, since most of my worked is locked up with my previous employer

## Setup

- Clone this repo
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev` to get the application running
- `npm run test:ui` for the full test display

## The application

There are two links at the top: One for the Admin view, and one for the Customer view.
I'm still working on getting the queries passed between them, but for now I have an example token for the customer view.
Simply paste `localhost:3000/customer?token=DatalignTest` the URL to see an example of an ad being served.
